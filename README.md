# Human-Action-Recognition
Step-by-step process for implementing an action recognition model using deep learning, specifically ConvLSTM and LRCN (Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network).

Step 1: Download and Visualize the Data with its Labels

Step 2: Preprocess the Dataset

Step 3: Split the Data into Train and Test Set

Step 4: Implement the ConvLSTM Approach

Step 4.1: Construct the Model

Step 4.2: Compile & Train the Model

Step 4.3: Plot Model’s Loss & Accuracy Curves

Step 5: implement the LRCN Approach

Step 5.1: Construct the Model

Step 5.2: Compile & Train the Model

Step 5.3: Plot Model’s Loss & Accuracy Curves

Step 6: Test the Best Performing Model on YouTube videos
